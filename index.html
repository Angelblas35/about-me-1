            <li>I was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, but I grew up in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle.</li>
            <li>For grade school, I was bussed across town to Whitworth Elementary School (now Orca) in Columbia City. Go Wildcats!</li>
            <li>I am currently binge watching "Psych". Unapologetically.</li>
            <li>I'm pretty approachable. Let's chat sometime.</li>
            <li>I want this to create a baseball player emoji that uses  d:)  ...It's a stretch goal of mine...</li>
        </ul>
